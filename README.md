# GDC-Method
Embedded secant predictor for tracing the postbuckling response with multi critical points based on generalized displacement control method

(1) Main.m is the main entry point of the project. You can modify this script to switch between different variants of the GDC algorithm. Simply run it, and the program will automatically carry out the computations.
(2) SolutionProcess.m implements the solver that performs the core numerical calculations.
(3) For each example, the file DisplVsLoad.svg shows the loadâ€“displacement curve, and GSP.svg shows the GSP curve.
